== GIT Audit Trail Plugin
- Uses git to version control your ActiveRecord object
- Versions are stored in YAML files so they can be easily read by humans or loaded into objects

== HOW IT WORKS:
Version control ActiveRecord model DATA with git. When a model is first activated for Git version controlling of it's records, a YAML file gets created containing the data for the ActiveRecord model. With each modification to the data, a new commit is created for the file storing the most recent data.

This happens by creating a new dir in the app root named "versions". This directory will store a separate YAML file for each "versioned" model. This directory is ignored by the applications Git repository, and a new repository is created inside that tracks only its contents.
